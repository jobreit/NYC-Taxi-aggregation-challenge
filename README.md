# NYC-Taxi-aggregation-challenge

This project explores the viability of pooling taxi rides in New York City by grouping riders which have similar origins
and destinations at similar times. After implementing the pooling algo, a little bit of data analysis and discussion provides
insights into the effectiveness/efficiency.
